DF-Peek
=======

watches Dwarf Fortress' logfile and launches external app when a regex matches. 
currently supports color highlighted output and beeping on death messages or messages that pauses the game.

it's simple: just add a line to df-log-filter.pl with a regex and a command, which will be executed when the regex matches.
actual textline is then passed to the app.


usage: tail -f ../df16/gamelog.txt | ~/df-peek/df-log-filter.pl

included are a color highlight script and a simple beep app (uses openal).

print-colored.pl [white|red|green|blue|yellow|magenta|cyan] text to print

to use beep, compile the beep executable by running "make". it uses openal to play a beep tone on the (active) soundcard.

to use the unpause feature, you have to download http://github.com/rofl0r/libxauto and run "make tools". then copy the 2 libxauto_* executables into this directory. it simply sends a SPACE keystroke to a X window with the title "Dwarf Fortress". this works with native linux as well with the windows version on linux used via wine.

NOTE: another (platform-independant) way to not pause on certain events is to edit data/init/announcements.txt
[MOOD_BUILDING_CLAIMED:A_D:D_D:P:R] just remove :P:R
this has the additional advantage that you can also stop the game from centering on the "hotspot".
