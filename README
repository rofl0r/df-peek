DF-Peek
=======

watches Dwarf Fortress' logfile and launches external app when a regex matches. 
currently supports color highlighted output and beeping on death messages or messages that pauses the game.


it's simple: just add a line to df-log-filter.pl with a regex and a command, which will be executed when the regex matches.
actual textline is then passed to the app.


usage: tail -f ../df16/gamelog.txt | ~/df-peek/df-log-filter.pl

included are a color highlight script and a simple beep app (uses openal).

print-colored.pl [beep|albeep] [white|red|green|blue|yellow|magenta|cyan] text to print

beep uses the pc-speaker, while albeep runs the beep executable which will be compiled when running "make"
